	abstract = {A general coefficient measuring the similarity between two sampling units is defined. The matrix of similarities between all pairs of sample units is shown to be positive semidefinite (except possibly when there are missing values). This is important for the multidimensional Euclidean representation of the sample and also establishes some inequalities amongst the similarities relating three individuals. The definition is extended to cope with a hierarchy of characters.},

	abstract = {Nonhomogeneous transmission systems occur in several practical conﬁgurations such as nonideally transposed overhead lines, cross-bonded cables, and river crossings of overhead lines. In the past, a compact and efﬁcient representation of nonhomogeneous system (NhS) was only possible in the frequency domain as the chain matrix (matrix transfer function) was used to obtain an equivalent nodal admittance matrix. Time-domain representation of a NhS demands explicit representation of each homogeneous section, thereby not being an efﬁcient solution. This work proposes to represent nonhomogeneous systems using a rational approximation which allows for a compact and accurate time-domain realization. In this approach, we exploit the fact that a NhS can be seen as a particular case of a frequencydependent network equivalent. The frequency dependence of the NhS is included via the rational modeling of the admittance matrix using the so-called Vector Fitting algorithm. Two test cases are considered to illustrate the gain of the proposed solution. The ﬁrst one is the modeling of a nonideally transposed transmission line, and the second one is a case of river crossing. To asses the accuracy of the modeling, the results are compared against the ones obtained either using the Numerical Laplace Transform and PSCAD.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an accurate method to evaluate the longitudinal parameters of multi-conductor overhead power lines, taking in account skin and proximity effects. This method has the foremost advantage of considering a non-homogeneous ground, composed by separate layers with different conductivities and having surface irregularities, such as hills or valleys. The method splits the system conductors (line and ground) into smaller sub-conductors, with variable rectangular cross-section. The method is validated by comparing the longitudinal impedance results with those obtained using both analytical equations and other numerical methods proposed in the literature. Analytical results presented are concerned to a cylindrical two-wire line and one-phase overhead line. Using the proposed method results are obtained for one-phase overhead line, considering the ground with different conductivity layers and with different topographies.},
